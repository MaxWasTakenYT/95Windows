###### *Current live version: 2B
###### *The cookies are not functioning as they should, the dark mode preference doesn't work (TO-DO)
###### *If the website doesn't work, try visiting the HTTP version: http://95Windows.rf.gd/
###### *Since Windows 95 *should be :)* abandonware, Microsoft don't kill me for this
###### *For the B/C product key generation script, i've used some of [@MobCat's](https://github.com/MobCat) and [@Endermanch's](https://github.com/Endermanch) research
